TACTICAL TRADING GUIDE: VIX9D SPREAD & HMM PANIC TRACKER
============================================================

For Weekly Option Sellers (Credit Spreads, Iron Condors, Naked Puts)

1. THE SPREAD FORMULA (Orange Line)
   Formula: VIX9D (9-Day) - VIX (30-Day)
   
   - Normal (Contango):   NEGATIVE Value (e.g., -1.5)
     Meaning: The market expects less drama in the next week than the next month.
     Action:  SAFE (Green Light) for weekly option selling.
     
   - Stressed (Backwardation): POSITIVE Value (e.g., +2.0)
     Meaning: Immediate panic. 9-day fear is higher than 30-day fear.
     Action:  STOP (Red Light). Do not sell weeklies. High risk of a gap down.

2. THE REGIME SIGNAL (Blue Line)
   HMM Panic Probability (0% to 100%)
   
   - Below 30%: High confidence in "Calm" regime. Optimal for Theta decay.
   - 30% - 70%: Transition Zone. Reduce position sizes by 50%.
   - Above 70%: Statistical Panic. Close existing short vol or hedge.

3. GOLDEN RULE FOR WEEKLY OPTIONS:
   Only sell when BOTH are true:
   1. Orange Line is BELOW 0.
   2. Blue Line is BELOW 30%.

If the Orange Line is spiked UP, stay in cash or buy protection.
