TACTICAL TRADING GUIDE: VIX9D SPREAD & HMM PANIC TRACKER
============================================================
Strategy: Weekly Option Selling (Credit Spreads, Iron Condors, Puts)

1. THE TRIPLE-CHECK SYSTEM (Check in this order)
------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 1: VIX Level (The "Yield" Check)
- Target: 15 to 25.
- Why: Below 15, the premium isn't worth the "tail risk." 
       Above 25, the market is too erratic for short-term weeklies.

STEP 2: VIX9D Spread (The "Safety" Check)
- Target: Negative Value (Orange Line below 0).
- Why: Contango means short-term fear is lower than long-term fear.
       Backwardation (Positive) means a price shock is imminent.

STEP 3: HMM Probability (The "Regime" Check)
- Target: Below 30% (Blue Line in lower territory).
- Why: High probability indicates a statistical shift into a "Crash Regime" 
       where standard technical analysis often fails.

2. VIX ABSOLUTE LEVEL GUIDELINES (Red Line)
------------------------------------------------------------
- < 13: LOW YIELD. Stay in cash or trade very small sizes. High danger of "Vol Spike."
- 15-22: SWEET SPOT. Optimal balance of high premium and predictable decay.
- 23-30: HIGH ALERT. Only sell if Orange Line is diving deep into Contango.
- > 30:  EXTREME DANGER. No unhedged weekly selling. Focus on capital preservation.

3. HMM REGIME PROBABILITY (Blue Line)
------------------------------------------------------------
- 0% - 30%:   CALM REGIME. Full tactical position sizing permitted.
- 30% - 70%:  TRANSITION. Cut position sizes by 50%. Watch for a "Regime Flip."
- 70% - 100%: PANIC REGIME. Close short premium. Delta-neutral or Cash only.

4. THE GOLDEN RULES FOR EXECUTION
------------------------------------------------------------
- SELL ONLY IF: VIX > 15 AND Spread < 0 AND HMM < 30%.
- THE EMERGENCY EXIT: If the Orange Line crosses above 0 while you have a 
  trade open, treat it as a "Hard Stop." Buy back your shorts immediately.
